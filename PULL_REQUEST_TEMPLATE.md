#### Single-line Summary
**Today, myself and I paired together. It took about 45 minutes.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. I went down the list of TODO items in the order they appeared on the page.
  2. First TODO was to add a meta tag for mobile viewing. Googled the proper syntax.
  3. Second TODO was to add a span class to the hamburger menu icon. Named it something simple like "icon-menu" since the jQuery practice was still fresh.
  4. Third TODO was to keep images from expanding past their containers. Gave them a max-width rule of 100% so they don't surpass limits.
  5. Fourth TODO was to make the icon-menu styles larger and on the right. Changed font size to 200% and floated it to the right. 
  6. Final TODO was to change style outlook with larger screens. It wanted the icon hidden and ul/li inline style.
